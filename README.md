# Money Laundering Prevention System

This project aims to predict the likelihood of backorders for products in a supply chain using machine learning techniques.  
Backorders occurs when a product is temporarily out of stock, and customers need to wait for it to become available again. By predicting potential backorders of a product, businesses can proactively manage their inventory and improve customer satisfaction.
